DESCRIPTION:
The Apostolic Faith Mission in Zambia Church Website is a custom-built, modern, and easy-to-navigate website designed and developed by me, Tim. This project was crafted to provide a digital platform for the church to share its mission, connect with the congregation, and showcase important updates such as events, sermons, and outreach programs.

I designed the website with simplicity, usability, and faith at its core. The code is clean, well-structured, and fully customizable, ensuring that it is easy for anyone to maintain or expand upon. Whether the goal is to provide updates, share sermons, or connect with the community, this website serves as a strong foundation for the church's online presence.
